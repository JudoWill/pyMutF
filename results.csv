In this study, deletion of NC domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag was found to drastically reduce virus particle production in CD4&#x0002b;T cells. Cellular fractionation experiments showed that although most of the uncleaved wild-type HIV-1 Gag, unmyristylated Gag, and  p6Gagdomain-truncated Gag molecules copurified with the host cell cytoskeleton, most of the mutant Gag molecules lacking both the NC and p6Gagdomains failed to cofractionate with cytoskeleton. In wild-type virus-infected cells, in which the viral protease was active, the cleaved NCp7 copurified with the cytoskeleton, whereas most of the MAp17 and CAp24 did not. Monoclonal antibody against actin coimmunoprecipitated full-length Gag and p6Gagdomain-truncated Gag molecules from cell lysates but failed to precipitate the truncated mutant Gag molecules lacking NC plus p6Gag. Purified recombinant NCp7, but not CAp24, was able to bind F-actin in cosedimentation experiments. Furthermore, wild-type NCp7 and a zinc finger mutant NCp7(F16A), like a cellular actin-binding protein (the villin headpiece), bound F-actin in a dose-dependent fashion in vitro.

Vpr,ADP/ATP translocase 1,291,binds,12750404,"The absence of immune defects that occurs in the syndrome of long-term nonprogressive (LTNP) HIV infection offers insights into the pathophysiology of HIV-induced immune disease. The (H&#x0005b;F/S&#x0005d;RIG)2domain of viral protein R (Vpr) induces apoptosis and may contribute to HIV-induced T cell depletion. We demonstrate a higher frequency of R77QVprmutations in patients with LTNP than in patients with progressive disease. In addition, T cell infections using vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) pseudotyped HIV-1VprR77Q result in less (P&#x0003d; 0.01) T cell death than infections using wild-typeVpr, despite similar levels of viral replication. Wild-typeVpr-associated events, including procaspase-8 and -3 cleavage, loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (&#x00394;&#x003c8;m), and DNA fragmentation factor activation are attenuated by R77Q Vpr. These data highlight the pathophysiologic role of Vpr in HIV-induced immune disease and suggest a novel mechanism of LTNP.",,R77Q,

(A) Plasmon surface resonance sensorgrams of the interaction of ANT with Vpr52-96, Vpr52-96[R73A,80A], or an irrelevant control (Co.). Only the sensorgram of the interaction with Vpr52-96 exhibits an increase of binding as a function of time and a positive signal at the start of the dissociation phase (off). The calculatedKD(KD=kon/koff) of the interaction is 9.7 &#x000b1; 6.4 nM (X &#x000b1; SD,n= 5).

Envelope transmembrane glycoprotein gp41,amyloid beta A4 protein isoform a precursor,351,downregulates,10527458,"To understand the mechanism underlying cognitive deficits in AIDS patients, we examined the influence of gp41 peptides on the expression and the secretion of Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein (APP) in human astroglial cell line T98G. Western blotting analyses demonstrated that treatment of glial cells with a putative immunosuppressive domain (aa 583-599) of gp41 remarkably downregulated the interleukin 1beta- (IL-1beta) induced elevation of the secreted form of APP (sAPP alpha) containing Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (KPI) domain without significant changes of the expression pattern of APP mRNAs as revealed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Recombinant gp41 protein encoding for ectodomain, including aa 583-599 residues, also elicited a similar dose-dependent inhibitory effect, whereas the control peptides resulted in little change. The molecular mechanism underlying this gp41-mediated reduction of sAPP alpha secretion appears not to be owing to the difference in the function of extracellular proteases based on the finding of similar proteolytic activities responsible for APP metabolism in vitro present in the conditioned media from the cultures treated with or without gp41 peptide. However, the known PKC inhibitors such as H-7 or staurosporine, partially inhibited the elevation of sAPP alpha secretion in response to protein kinase C (PKC) agonist phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PdBu) as well as to IL-1beta, mimicking the immunosuppressive gp41 peptide. These observations implicate that part of the neurodegenerative cascade in AIDS brains may involve the inhibitory effect of gp41 on secretion of sAPP alpha, a potent glial neurotrophic factor, through impaired PKC response.",,T98G,
"Envelope surface glycoprotein gp160, precursor",tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6 isoform 1 precursor,355,interacts with,10625668,"Accelerated apoptosis is one mechanism proposed for the loss of CD4+ T-lymphocytes in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, gp160, contains two C-terminal calmodulin-binding domains. Expression of gp160 in Jurkat T-cells results in increased sensitivity to FAS- and ceramide-mediated apoptosis. The pro-apoptotic effect of gp160 expression is blocked by two calmodulin antagonists, tamoxifen and trifluoperazine. This enhanced apoptosis in response to FAS antibody or C(2)-ceramide is associated with activation of caspase 3, a critical mediator of apoptosis. A point mutation in the C-terminal calmodulin-binding domain of gp160 (alanine 835 to tryptophan, A835W) eliminates gp160-dependent enhanced FAS-mediated apoptosis in transiently transfected cells, as well as in vitro calmodulin binding to a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal calmodulin-binding domain of gp160. Stable Tet-off Jurkat cell lines were developed that inducibly express wild type gp160 or gp160A835W. Increasing expression of wild type gp160, but not gp160A835W, correlates with increased calmodulin levels, increased apoptosis, and caspase 3 activation in response to anti-FAS treatment. The data indicate that gp160-enhanced apoptosis is dependent upon calmodulin up-regulation, involves the activation of caspase 3, and requires calmodulin binding to the C-terminal binding domain of gp160.",,A835W,
