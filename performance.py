""" Description
File created on 02 Feb 2007.

This file can be used as a script for judging the performance of a 
MutationExtractor object compared to a gold standard, or the objects 
can be imported to automate comparisons of MutationExtractors.

Script usage:
> performance.py /path/to/extracted/mutations /path/to/gold/standard
> performance.py -h

Direct use of objects (e.g.):
from mutation_finder import extract_mutations_from_lines_to_dict

pc = PerformanceCalculator(parse_extraction_data(open(\
    '/path/to/gold/standard')))
pcr = pc.calculate_extracted_mentions(\
    extract_mutations_from_lines_to_dict(open(\
    '/path/to/input/text')))

print pcr.FMeasure

    """ An object to store results from a PerformanceCalculator 

        This is the data type returned by the PerformanceCalculator methods,
            and keeps track of the true positives, false positives, false 
            negatives, and true negatives. Additionally it calculates
            precision, recall, and f-measure from these data, and provides
            pretty printing of all of these metrics. After initializing 
            a PerformanceCalculatorResult, such as:
            
            pcr = PerformanceCalculatorResult(tp,fp,fn,tn)

            All of the values can be accessed as:
            
            pcr.TruePositive
            pcr.FalsePositive
            pcr.FalseNegative
            pcr.TrueNegative
            pcr.Precision
            pcr.Recall
            pcr.FMeasure

            This will allow for convenient programmatic access to these
            metrics, and therefore is useful for automated comparisons of 
            extraction systems, as would be done if you were automatically 
            optimizing a system on any of the individual metrics.

    """ A class for calculating performance metrics of MutationExtractors 

        Three performance metrics, described in (Caporaso et al., 2007)
            are calculated by comparing the results of a mutation
            extraction system (extractor_output) with a gold standard 
            data set (gold_standard). These are in identical format,
            a 2D dict, where top-level keys represent document identifiers
            and 2nd-level keys are mutations in wNm format with their 
            counts as values. Counts must be positive integers for the
            results to be meaningful, but this IS NOT EXPLICITLY TESTED.
        Example format for gold_standard and extractor_results dicts:

            {'3476160': {'S87C': 1, 'T22C': 1}, '14500716': {}, 
            '12206666': {'D95A': 4, 'D95N': 2, 'D95E': 2},
            '11327835': {'H64A': 4}}

        In this example, PubMed Identifiers (PMIDs) serve as the top-level
            keys. 

        For these calculations to be accurate, the gold standard and the
            extractor output must represent extraction of mutations from
            an identical collection of texts. Since this is an easy 
            mistake to make (e.g. accidentally creating a 'sparse' input,
            where only documents with mutations are provided) this IS 
            EXPLICITLY TESTED. An error is 
            raised if the keys in the two dicts (self._gold_standard and
            extractor_output) are not identical. This is determined in two 
            steps: first, the lengths of both are calculated, and must be 
            equal; next, when iterating over the gold standard, if a key
            is found which is not in extractor output, an error is raised.
            These two tests ensure equality between the set of keys in 
            each, and are performed each time extractor_output is passed
            to one of the methods.
